# Genetic Algorithm Problem
Genetic Algorithm is one of the most widely used evolutionary algorithms used to solve optimization problems and find near-optimal solutions. The purpose of this project is to compare and investigate two examples of binary and real genetic algorithms with Michalewicz’s function as a fitness function.<br>

## Features

•	Michalewicz’s function as a fitness function<br>
•	Comparison of Binary Genetic and Real Genetic<br>
•	Roulette Wheel and Tournament Selection<br>
•	Single point, Two-point and Uniform Crossover for Binary Genetic<br>
•	Math, Line Recombination and BLX-a Crossover for Real Genetic<br>
•	Uniform Mutation<br>


## How to test it?
Run Main.java and set any function that you need in your custom scenarios.
We have 18 scenarios. For example, the result of real genetic algorithm by Roulette Wheel selection, Math Crossover and uniform mutation is:
